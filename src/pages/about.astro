		<h1>About</h1>

        <h2>Festival Experience</h2>

        <p>Karrusel believes in the right to a harassment-free festival experience. We believe in the right of everyone to express themselves. Karrusel welcomes everybody
         all with their different orientations, experiences, histories and backgrounds. Karrusel only exists if everyone takes care of each other, respects their own and others boundaries, embraces diversity and acts as a part of the community.

</p>

<p>Take responsibility for your own actions
    Respect your own and others boundaries
    Speak up rather than look the other way</p>
